        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        One of you will be selected at random to be <b>Employer</b>; the other will be <b>Worker</b>.
        You will learn whether you are Employer or Worker prior to making any decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Employer is going to hire a Worker to complete a word encoding task you just saw. To start, 
        Employer will send a wage offer to the Worker and the wage offer is an integer above {{ wage_low }}.
        In the meantime, Worker will be asked to enter their minimal acceptable wage above {{ wage_low }} for completing the task. 
        Then if Employer's wage offer is greater than the Worker's minimal acceptable wage, the computer will automatically 
        help the Worker to accept it; if not, the computer will automatically reject it. 
        Then both Employer and Worker will be directed to the word encoding task.

        The Employer is going to hire a Worker to complete a word encoding task you just saw. To start, 
        Employer will send a wage offer to the Worker. Since the government is implementing the <b>Minimum 
        Wage</b> policy now, the wage offer should be an integer above the minimum wage {{ min_wage }}. 
        In the meantime, Worker will be asked to enter their minimal acceptable wage above {{ wage_low }} for completing the task. 
        Then if Employer's wage offer is greater than the Worker's minimal acceptable wage, the computer will automatically 
        help the Worker to accept it; if not, the computer will automatically reject it.

        If the Employer's wage offer is accepted by the Worker, then the payoff for the Employer is <b><math>
        {{ base_revenue }} + ({{ point_per_correct_letter }} &times; Number of Correct Entries Made By Worker) - Wage Offer </math></b>.
        The payoff for the Worker is <b><math>Wage Offer</math></b>. 

        If the Employer's wage offer is rejected by the Worker, then the payoff for the Employer and the 
        Worker is both <b>0 points</b>.
