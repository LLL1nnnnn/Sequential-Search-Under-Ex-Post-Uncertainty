<p>
    In the following, you will be making 10 decisions. Each decision corresponds to the choice between <b>Option A</b> and 
    <b>Option B</b>. Since there is no right answer, the decision merely reflects your preference. 
</p>

<p>
    Option A always offers <b>{{ lottery_a }}</b> points for sure, while Option B offers a centain chance to receive 
    <b>{{ lottery_b_hi }}</b> points and a certain chance to receive <b>{{ lottery_b_lo }}</b> points. 
    
    Each row of the decision table contains a pair of choices between Option A and Option B.
    You make your choice by clicking on one of the radio buttons to the left of both options. 
    Only one option in each row can be selected, and you may change your decision as you wish. 
    While the payoffs of the two options are fixed for all decisions, the chance of getting the two outcomes for 
    Option B varies among the 10 decisions. 
</p>
<p>
    Even though you will make 10 decisions, only one of these will end up being used. The selection of the one 
    to be used depends on the computer's random number generator. No decision is any more likely to be used than 
    any other, and you will not know in advance which one will be selected, so please think about each decision carefully. 
    This random selection of a decision fixes the row (i.e. the decision) that will be used.
</p>
<p>
    After the decision row is selected, your payoff depends on the option you chose (Option A or Option B). 

    If you chose Option A, you will receive <b>{{ lottery_a }}</b> points. 
    If you chose Option B, you can receive either <b>{{ lottery_b_hi }}</b> points <b>or</b> <b>{{ lottery_b_lo }}</b> points. 
    To determine your earnings in the case you chose Option B, the computer will randomly draw an integer between 1 and 10 
    (including 1 and 10). For example, suppose that you chose Option B of the decision row which shows "4/10 of {{ lottery_b_hi }} 
    points, 6/10 of {{ lottery_b_lo }} points", then a random drawn number of 1, 2, 3, or 4 will result in {{ lottery_b_hi }} 
    points, and a random drawn number of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 will result in {{ lottery_b_lo }} points. 
</p>
<!-- <p>
    To summarize: You will make 10 choices; for each decision you will have to choose between "Option A" and "Option B". 
    You may choose "Option A" for some decision rows and "Option B" for other rows. When you are finished, one of the 
    10 decisions will be randomly picked for your payoff. Then a random pick will determine your payment for the option 
    you chose in that decision.
</p> -->

<p>
    To summarize, you will indicate an option, A or B, for each of the rows by clicking on the "radio buttons" 
    on the left side of the options. 
    Then a random number fixes which row of the table (i.e. which decision) is relevant for your earnings.
    In that row, your decision fixed the choice for that row, Option A or Option B. If you chose Option A, 
    then you get a sure payoff; if you chose Option B, then a final random number will determine the money 
    payoff for the decision you made.
