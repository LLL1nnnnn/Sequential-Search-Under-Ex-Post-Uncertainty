    In this task, you will play {{ Constants.num_rounds }} rounds of a search game.

        In each round, you are going to search for an item to purchase. The value of the item is always {{ endowment }} points.

        <p>
            The cost of each item is an integer between <b>{{ value_low }} points</b> and <b>{{ value_high }} points</b> (inclusive, the outcomes are chosen with equal possibilities). 
            
            The items differ in the cost (i.e. the points you will lose). 
            
            After each search, you will know the cost of the item you just searched.

            You start with no item on your searched list. 
            
            You can choose to search for a new item at a constant cost of <b>{{ search_cost }}</b> points per search by clicking on Search button. 
            
            With the current searched list, you can choose to purchase an item by entering the <b>Search No.</b> of the item that you want to purchase in the box 
            and clicking on the <b>Purchase</b> button; or you may keep searching for the next new item at a constant cost of <b>{{ search_cost }}</b> points.
